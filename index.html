      <h3>Birth and Rebirth Cycle</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>It was born in 1933</li>
        <article><p>Only the second building project of its kind Model City was
          even more diverse than it is today. It was home to all the "other colors"
          that the laws of the day segregated. Miami was the home of the working man post depression.
        Everyone was coming into Miami for the steady construction work. As the Miami economy
        and public services were leagues above the rural establishment of the time. During, this
        period American Blacks the "South" and long time residents from Overtown began to pour in.</p>

        <li>Lyndon Johnson's effect on south florida in 1966 </li>
        <article><p>This was the time when Liberty City had the most Middle-Class flight. After,
          the covenant housing laws ending so to did the communities exposer to middle-class leadership
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Cities_Program">Read about other "Model Cites"</a>Widespread urban violence, disillusionment with existing urban renewal programmes,
          and bureaucratic difficulties in the first years of the War on Poverty led to
          calls for reform of federal programmes. The Model Cities initiative created a
          new program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intended
          to improve coordination of existing urban programs.</p>

        <li> Authorized to Riot, Liberty City resident declare War on Miami</li>
        <article><p>Basically, a well known story about racism and legal abuse of power, is that
        of Author McDuffie. Police (if they even could be called such) were a necessary evil in Miami. The United States
        was under siege in the last sixties and early seventies by a Drug Trade that was spilling over its Florida border.
        So national money was set a side to accelerate the number of police in the county to match the outbreaks of violence
        facing Miami for the very first time since its founding. Great and illustrious criminial made millions from corrupting
        this new police force. Author McDuffie's murder was only a symptom of the cancer of Miami's legal arms. However, let me
        be perfectly clear the response was equally violent and abusing. People were murdered and the foundation of Government
        was marched upon with violent intent. Finally, war powers were evoked and the riots ended but with the City of Miami forever
        tramatized by its inability to converge openly with culturally different communities.</p>

        <li>Finally the curse is lifted in 2015 </li>
        <article><p>All things must end. Even curses are one day broken. In 2015, the City was again experiencing the pangs of social poverty
        caused primarily the citizens financial and intellectual fragility. Too many single mom, war veterans, pastors, and children live in
        reside in a neighborhood where random crime and poor decisions are common. Someone brought out the Landlord's stake in the property. A
        A wealthy experienced real estate mogul from overseas. He came in like a prince on a white horse ready to save and up lift the downtridden
        from their ditch called Liberty City.<a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article8590790.html">The
        announcement was made</a> He had big money and even bigger promises but would he deliever. Only time would tell.</p>

        <li>Today in Liberty City</li>
        <article><p>Finally, the old projects that stood, rusted and rotten for over 80 plus years will be ripped down. A new neighborhood will rise
        in its place. The plan for this space is to accelerate the people's heart's and minds who live there. An environment that will gentrify <thead>
        historically impoverished from the inside out. Provide opportunity for all through access for all.
